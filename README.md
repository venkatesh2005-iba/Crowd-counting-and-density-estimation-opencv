# Crowd-counting-and-density-estimation-opencv
📌 Overview
This project leverages OpenCV and Python to estimate crowd density and count individuals in video footage. By processing video frames, it detects human figures and computes crowd density maps, aiding in applications like public safety, event management, and urban planning.

💡 Features
Crowd Counting: Estimates the number of people in a given area.

Density Estimation: Generates density maps highlighting crowded regions.

Real-Time Processing: Analyzes video frames in real-time for immediate feedback.

Visualization: Displays annotated frames with crowd counts and density maps.

🛠 Requirements
Python 3.x

OpenCV

NumPy

Matplotlib

📥 Installation
Clone the repository:

bash

🚀 Usage
Run the main script to start processing a video file:

bash
Copy
Edit
python main.py --video path_to_video.mp4
Replace path_to_video.mp4 with the path to your video file.
