# Crowd-counting-and-density-estimation-opencv
ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project leverages OpenCV and Python to estimate crowd density and count individuals in video footage. By processing video frames, it detects human figures and computes crowd density maps, aiding in applications like public safety, event management, and urban planning.

ðŸ’¡ Features
Crowd Counting: Estimates the number of people in a given area.

Density Estimation: Generates density maps highlighting crowded regions.

Real-Time Processing: Analyzes video frames in real-time for immediate feedback.

Visualization: Displays annotated frames with crowd counts and density maps.

ðŸ›  Requirements
Python 3.x

OpenCV

NumPy

Matplotlib

ðŸ“¥ Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/venkatesh2005-iba/Crowd-counting-and-density-estimation-opencv.git
cd Crowd-counting-and-density-estimation-opencv
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
ðŸš€ Usage
Run the main script to start processing a video file:

bash
Copy
Edit
python main.py --video path_to_video.mp4
Replace path_to_video.mp4 with the path to your video file.

ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
main.py: Main script for crowd analysis

utils.py: Helper functions (e.g., frame processing, visualization)
